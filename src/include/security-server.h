 * \par Description:
 * Retreives Linux group ID from object name which is passed by parameter
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * This API may be used before security_server_check_privilege() API by middleware daemon to get group ID of a specific object.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * In middleware daemon, before checking privilege of a service the daemon need to know the GID of the service. This API support the functionality.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * Opens /etc/group file and searches the object name as group name. If there is matching result, returns GID as integer
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a Synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * - This API is only allowed to be called by pre-defined middleware daemon
 *
 * \param[in] object Name of the object which is kwnown by the caller.

 * \remarks the cookie is not a null terminated string. Cookie is a BINARY byte stream of such length which can be retrieved by security_server_get_cookie_size() API.
 * Therefore, please do not use strcpy() family to process cookie value. You MUST use memcpy() function to process cookie value.
 * You also have to know that the cookie value doesn't carry any null terminator. So you don't need to allocate 1 more byte of the cookie size.

 * \par Description:

 * \par Purpose:
 * This API should be used by applications which has phone UI lock capability.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * Lock screen calls this API after user typed phone password and pressed okay.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * Sends challenged password to security-server, security-server compares hashed current password and hashed challenged password.
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a Synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * There is retry timer on this API to limit replay attack. You will get error if you called this API too often.\n
 *
 * \param[in] challenge Null terminated challenged password string. It must not a NULL pointer.
 * \param[out] current_attempts Number of password check missed attempts.
 * \param[out] max_attempts Number of maximum attempts that the password locks. 0 means infinite
 * \param[out] valid_secs Remaining time in second which represents this password will be expired. 0xFFFFFFFF means infinite
 *
